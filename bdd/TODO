Replace awkward vec2normalize with calls to vec2normalized.

Generally: Track down imperative access to vec2, mat22, and transform.
Replace with functional ones.

Replace vec2 with real * real.
Replace mat22 with real^4.

Replace initialize_manifold with create_manifold or something.


looks like I wrote common/*.cpp in a number of comments where I meant collision/*.cpp.
