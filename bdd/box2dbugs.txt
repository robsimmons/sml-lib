
Notes from my porting project; most are just typos:

b2PolygonShape.cpp:

  "It's location doesn't" -> "Its location doesn't"
  (in both copies of this code :))

b2Distance.h:

  The comment for the b2DistanceInput struct is incomplete. (?)

  The comment for b2Distance mentions b2EdgeShape, which doesn't seem
  to exist. Moreover, the code doesn't care about shapes at all; it
  just uses the proxies in the input.

b2Distance.cpp:

  Is the break inside b2Distance ("ensure progress") supposed to
  be commented out? If it is, then there's some dead code, like all
  of the distanceSqr calculations.

  In the cuts of the GJK loop, the declaration
  b2Vec2 wBLocal;
  is dead.

  "still no overlapped" -> "still not overlapped"

b2DynamicTree.h:

  "perform a exact" -> "perform an exact"

  The comment

    // Separating axis for segment (Gino, p80).
    // |dot(v, p1 - c)| > dot(|v|, h)

  appears out of place in the RayCast function before it is repeated
  in a meaningful spot.

b2DynamicTree.cpp:

  The "find the best sibling" loop is an if..do..while which is
  exactly equivalent to a simpler while loop.

  
b2BroadPhase.h:

  "call UpdatePairs to finalized" -> "call UpdatePairs to finalize"

b2BroadPhase.cpp:

  "and add them pair buffer" -> "and add them to the pair buffer"

b2TimeOfImpact.cpp:

  The return value of b2SeparationFunction::Initialize isn't used.
  This might be better as a constructor.
  



Several of the examples in the manual.html write "b2Transfrom" instead
of "b2Transform".
