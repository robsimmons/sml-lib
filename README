This is my library for Standard ML, which I use for pretty much every
project. It is essentially a grab-bag library with a write-as-needed
strategy. I import other people's stable libraries (if they have free
licenses) when I use them and then sometimes make them conform to my
personal style, unsophisticated build management practices, or
distaste for boilerplate. Some other people use and contribute to this
library, too. I welcome your contributions too but I use a dictatorial
strategy for the library's arrangement.

Where not indicated in the accompanying README, these utilities are
licensed with the GNU Public License (GPL). See the file COPYING for
details.

The subdirectories are as follows:

 algo - Algorithms (LZW, Heaps, Edit Distance, ...)
 crypt - Cryptographic functions (MD5, SHA-1, DES, ...)
 data - Data structures (functional queue, circular buffer, trie, ...)
 files - Implementations of file formats (XML, MIDI, .wav, ...)
 geom - Geometric algorithms and data structures
 misc - Stuff that didn't fit elsewhere (base64, fixed words, parameter parsing, ...)
 mlton - Glue for connecting MLton to external libraries through its FFI (mySql, X Windows)
 njlib - My most-used parts of the SML/NJ library (splay trees)
 parse - Combinator parsing library
 port - A uniform interface to some non-standard features available in several SML compilers
 text - Utilities for processing text
 util - Utilities that go with existing structures (lists, strings, file system, etc.)
