
Algorithms and data structures for computational geometry.

polygon        -  Abstract representation of polygons.

quadtree       -  (Actually kd-trees.) Stores points in two-dimensional 
                  space, and supports efficient queries for all of the
                  points within a circle.

pointlocation  -  Given a bunch of non-overlapping polygons, quickly 
                  return the polygon that a point is in.

latlon         -  Latitude and Longitude pairs on the Earth. Projections into
                  two dimensions and very accurate great circle
                  distances between pairs of locations.

latlontree     -  Like Quadtree, but for points on the Earth.

snappoints     -  Merges nearby points that aren't on the same polygon,
                  for building exact subdivisions of space.
