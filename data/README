This directory contains some standard data structures. Also see the
parallel directory "algo" since it is sometimes difficult to
distinguish an algorithm from a data structure.

lastn-buffer  -  Efficient fixed-length array (circular buffer).
nmarkov       -  Sparse markov chains, generalized to n states of history.
                 Can also stream observations in probability order.
queue         -  Efficient functional queues (double-list trick).
trie          -  Standard trie data structure, functorized.
unionfind     -  Classic Union-Find algorithm for equivalence classes.
undostate     -  Simple implementation of undo buffers.
