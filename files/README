A collection of modules for reading and writing file formats.

reader     -  An abstract interface to "readable" things (with the ability
              to do arbitrary seeking); currently files on disk or in
              memory. This is also useful for parsing packets in a binary
              oriented network protocol.
           
              (Note that files are currently loaded into memory, so this
              implementation is not efficient for large files yet!)
           
elf        -  Reads ELF "executable and linking format" files. This is
              incomplete, but could be useful if you just need minimal
              functionality.
           
csv        -  Fairly standards-compliant read support for
              comma-separated-value files.
           
midi       -  Reads and writes standard MIDI files. This is pretty much
              complete, except for some support for obscure features like
              split SYSEX data.
           
mp3        -  Reads and writes MP3 ID3v1.1 tags. No support for any audio.
           
wave       -  Reads and writes AIFF 'WAVE' files.
           
netpbm     -  Reads a subset of the trivial netPBM graphic format.
           
xml        -  Andreas Naumann's FXP parser (only) for XML. BSD-like license.
              This parser is highly featureful, but complex to use. I provide
              simplified interface in xml/xml-sig.sml.
           
svg        -  Parser for path strings in SVG. Doesn't parse full SVG files.
              Also includes dead-simple string-based SVG output.

embroidery -  Reads and writes embroidery file formats (currently just partial
              support for PES).
