prime.sml        Utilities for prime number generation and testing.

number.sml       Number theoretic algorithms for IntInf.int types that are
                 useful in cryptography.

mersenne-twister.sml   Good fast pseudorandom number generator.

cryptrand.sml    Utilities for cryptographic random numbers. CURRENTLY ONLY
